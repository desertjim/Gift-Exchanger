Forward:

gift_exchanger.py is a simple script designed to make gift exchanges fast.
Appologies as it was written rather quickly and could use improvement.


Directions:

1. Edit gift_exchanger.py:
Set people to contain a list of people participating in the gift exchange
	people = ["janice", "henry", "james", "jeff", "ramsey", "drew", "kim"]
Set dont_match to be a list of tuples of people not participating in the 
the gift exchange
	dont_match=[("janice", "henry"), ("jen","kim")]
2. Run the program:
python gift_exchanger.py 
jeff -> janice -> james -> henry -> ramsey -> drew -> kim -> jeff
In this example Jeff is buying for Janice and Janice is buying for James...
